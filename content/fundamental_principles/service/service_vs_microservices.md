La ressource, nous donnes les définitions suivantes

## Service

> According to the [OASIS definition], a service is a mechanism that enables access to one or more capabilities. In our case, these capabilities might be executing commands, querying, or raising events. All of them make up a service’s public interface.

## Microservice
> If a service is a mechanism that enables access to one or more publicly executable operations, then a microservice is a service with a “micro” public interface. It provides as few public operations as possible - literally, a “micro”-service.

> The microservices architecture is the decomposition of a _system_ into a _set of services_, such that all services will have _minimal public interfaces_.
