L'IEEE nous donne plusieurs définitions qui sont retranscrites ici

## Design

1. Process to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system
   element
2. Process of defining the software architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a software system to satisfy specified requirements

## System Design

1. Process of defining the hardware and Software architecture, components, modules, interfaces and data for a
   system to satisfy specified requirements (_même définition qu'au dessus mais en ajoutant le hardware_)

## Software Design

1. Use of scientific principles, technical information, and imagination in the definition of a software system to
   perform pre‐specified functions with maximum economy and efficiency

## Architectural Design

1. Process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the
   framework for the development of a computer system
2. The result of defining a collection of hardware and
   software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system

## Architecture

1. System fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements,
   relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution
2. set of rules to define the structure of a system and the
   interrelationships between its parts (e.g. component, module, subprogram, routine)
