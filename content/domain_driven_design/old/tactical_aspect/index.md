The tactical patterns are really focused on what happens inside each bounded context. People who suggest DDD isnt neccessary all the time, dont understand that the DDD tactical patterns arent always needed, but the strategic tools/patterns actually are very useful almost all of the time. Usually these people dont realise the strategic patterns really exist or understand their full use. This is not meant as an insult, its just difficult to get your head around at the start. Tactical patterns are designing aggregates, identifying aggregate roots, defining value objects, domain services, application services, domain events etc. You could compare the tactical patterns to onion/clean architecture. These are primarly low level, bounded context patterns.
